title: Yet Another Blog
description: The first of some to come.
---

This is both a test post and also an introduction to the blog portion of this website.

While I am very grateful to those out there who write blog posts talking about new technology, libraries, and tutorials on such, and have saved me countless hours of poring through documentation hoping to glean something, I myself have no interest in writing about such topics, even though I'm a software engineer.

Instead, this will be a place for me to both showcase myself as well as write about random things that happen(ed) in my life from a mostly humorous (retro)spective.

While I might come off as (very) dry in my writing, let me preface future posts by saying that I'm nowhere near as deadpan or dry in real life. There's probably a correlation there that I'm not seeing, but that's for someone else to figure out.
