This is both a test post and also an introduction into the blog portion of this website.

While I am very grateful to those out there who write blog posts talking about new technology, libraries, and tutorials on such, and have saved me countless hours of trolling through documentation hoping to glean something, I myself have no interest in writing about such topics, even though I'm a software engineer.

Instead, this will be place for me to both showcase myself and write about random things that happen(ed) in my life from a mostly humorous (retro)spective

While I might come off as (very) dry in my writing, I feel I should preface future posts with the fact that I'm nowhere near as deadpan or dry in real life. There's probably a correlation there that I'm not seeing, but that's for someone else to figure out.
